# Understanding Port Scanning: A Defender's Perspective

Port scanning is often associated with malicious activity, but it's also one of the most valuable tools in a defender's arsenal. By understanding how attackers enumerate your network, you can better protect it.

## What is Port Scanning?

At its core, port scanning is the process of probing a server or host for open ports. Think of ports as doors into a building—each open port is a potential entry point that could be exploited if not properly secured.

When you connect to a website, you're typically using port 443 (HTTPS) or port 80 (HTTP). But servers often run many more services:

- **Port 22** - SSH (Secure Shell)
- **Port 25** - SMTP (Email)
- **Port 3306** - MySQL Database
- **Port 5432** - PostgreSQL Database
- **Port 6379** - Redis

Each open port represents a service that could potentially be exploited.

## Common Scanning Techniques

### TCP Connect Scan

The most straightforward approach—complete the full TCP three-way handshake:

1. Send SYN packet
2. Receive SYN-ACK (port open) or RST (port closed)
3. Send ACK to complete connection

This is reliable but noisy. Every connection attempt is logged by the target.

### SYN Scan (Half-Open)

Also called "stealth scanning," this technique sends SYN packets but never completes the handshake:

1. Send SYN packet
2. Receive SYN-ACK (port open) or RST (port closed)
3. Send RST instead of ACK

This was historically harder to detect, though modern IDS/IPS systems catch it easily.

### UDP Scanning

UDP is connectionless, making scanning trickier:

- Send UDP packet to port
- No response might mean open (or filtered)
- ICMP "port unreachable" means closed

UDP scans are slow and often unreliable.

## Why Defenders Should Scan Their Own Networks

**Know your attack surface.** You can't protect what you don't know exists. Regular scanning helps you:

1. **Discover shadow IT** - Find unauthorized services running on your network
2. **Verify firewall rules** - Confirm only intended ports are accessible
3. **Detect misconfigurations** - Catch services accidentally exposed to the internet
4. **Track changes over time** - Notice when new ports open unexpectedly

## Building a Scanning Strategy

### External Scanning

Scan your public-facing infrastructure from outside your network. This shows you what attackers see:

- Use a cloud server or external scanning service
- Scan all 65,535 TCP ports periodically
- Don't forget UDP for services like DNS (53) and SNMP (161)

### Internal Scanning

Scan from within your network to understand lateral movement risks:

- What can an attacker access if they breach your perimeter?
- Are internal services properly segmented?
- Can one compromised host reach sensitive databases?

## Defensive Measures

Once you understand your exposure, take action:

1. **Close unnecessary ports** - If a service isn't needed, shut it down
2. **Apply firewall rules** - Restrict access to sensitive ports by IP
3. **Use network segmentation** - Limit blast radius of a breach
4. **Monitor for scans** - Detect when others are probing you
5. **Keep services updated** - Patch vulnerabilities in exposed services

## Conclusion

Port scanning isn't inherently malicious—it's reconnaissance. By scanning your own networks regularly, you gain the same visibility attackers seek. The difference is what you do with that information: attackers look for weaknesses to exploit, while defenders use it to strengthen their security posture.

Proactive security means knowing your attack surface before attackers do.
